    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Video games generate a lot of information about how players behave. The UBC Computer Science research group led by Frank Wood is running a special Minecraft research server to study these behaviours. Every time a player joins the server, their actions and play sessions are recorded. In this project, we wants to use this data to understand players better and also to improve how they can run the server in a more efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding which players tend to generate the most gameplay data is especially important, as they can bring us more information so we can figure out way to improve. The research has shown that playtime across different groups. International studies have reported differences in the played hours across genders. Some finding that men tend to spend more time gaming than women on average (Rehbein et al., 2016). Other work shows that gaming participation is also different across age groups: roughly half of both men and women report playing some form of video game. Young adults are the most active players, while many adults aged 50–64 and even 65+ also play regularly (Bunz et al., 2020). These researches indicates that age and gender may meaningfully decide on gaming behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we research about whether similar patterns appear in the Minecraft research server data. Specifically, we aim to identify which “kinds” of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of gameplay data so that efforts can be spent on those groups more effectively. Players who play longer produce richer behavioural data, which is valuable for future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focuses on the general question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is very meaningful because players who play longer create more data, which is helpful for the research group. If we can predict which players will have longer playtime, the team can focus their efforts on those types of players and generate more useful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific question that we're hoping to answer is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can age, gender, and experience level predict the total number of hours a player plays on the MineCraft server using the players dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we used the dataset: players.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players dataset contains 196 unique players. Each row represents one player and includes their basic information and their overall gameplay history. The dataset has 7 variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "|Variable Name | Type | Description |\n",
    "|--------------| -----| ------------|\n",
    "|experience | categorical (factor) | How familiar the player is with Minecraft (“Beginner”, “Intermediate”, “Expert”, \"Pro\", \"Regular\")|\n",
    "|subscribe | categorical (logical) | Whether or not the player has a game subscription (subscribed= TRUE)|\n",
    "|hashedEmail | String | A hashed version of the player's email address. Not useful for modelling. An ID for each player|\n",
    "|played_hours | numeric (continuous) | TThe total number of hours the player has spent on the server across all sessions. This is the **response variable**|\n",
    "|name| String/Categorical | Player's chosen name on game server. Not useful for modelling|\n",
    "|gender| Categorical (factor) | Self reported gender category of the players |\n",
    "|age| Numeric (integer) | Player's age in years (2 missing values)|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will show how we tidied and wrangled the data, built and choose our model, and analyzed the results to understand what types of players tend to play more on the server."

    "## Methods\n",
    "#### 1. Tidying and wrangling the data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we imported all necessary libraries necessary for data analysis, and read our data from a URL that was linked to our GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we tidied the data so we could use it for our data analysis when building prediction models for the data. We ensured that our final data table satisfied the requirements of tidy data: each row is a single observation, each column is a single variable, and each value is a single cell. We also ensured that the final data set only included the variables we wanted to look at when we wanted to build our model. This included removing variables/columns such as `hashedEmail`, `name`, and `subscribe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we made visualizations showcasing the relationship between each of our independent variables (`Age`, `gender`, and `experience`) with our dependent variable (`played_hours`) to better understand whether there even was a detectable relationship between the variables we would be creating a regression model with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Building regression models for the data\n",
    "\n",
    "After gaining a better understanding of the relationships between our variables and tidying our data, we were ready to create a prediction model. Since we're planning to predict a numerical value, we chose to build a regression model rather than a classification model. Prior to starting our data analysis here, we were unsure as to which model would be better: KNN or linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which model was better, we have to consider the relationship between some of the variables. Since we have three predictor variables, our pattern will most likely not be the most linear, so using a KNN regression may be better because it can fit more complex patterns. Moreover, this flexibility in KNN regression may be helpful because our multivariable regression will most likely be non-linear. Based on this logic, using a KNN regression instead of a linear regression may be advantageous as it can result in a smaller RMSPE (root mean square prediction error) value. A smaller RMSPE value would indicate that the model made fewer errors in the sense that the model's predictions were closer in distance to the real values.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we set a seed to ensure that our data is reproducible and that R splits the data the same way randomly every time our code is run. Then, we decided to split our tidy data into a training and testing set. We would first train and tune our models with our training set and then apply the model on the testing set to evaluate its performance."

    "Now, we start working on creating the model. The first step is to add a recipe, where we specify the response variable, `played_hours_log`, and the predictor variables: `experience_fct`, `Age`, and `gender_fct`. Since we have factor (categorical) variables, we use `step_dummy()` to turn these variables into **dummy** numerical variables, since our model can't really understand non-numerical variables. `step_zv` is used  to check every predictor and removes columns that only have one observation and 0 variance. `step_scale()` and `step_center` is used to scale and standardized so now it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a specification where we train the classifier and specify that it's a KNN regression. We used the `tune()` function in neighbours so we can perform cross-validation using `vfold_cv()`. Having more folds gives us better estimates with less variance. Finally, we can prepare a workflow where we bring everything together and train the classifier."

    "To further see the relationship between the k values and their associated RMSE value, a line graph was made. Based on the graph, lower k values than that of the determined `k_min` seemed to have a higher RMSE, which could be indicative that the model would be influenced by every data point, making it overfit the data. However, if we look at the RMSE values past the `k_min` value, we see that there are not that many drastic changes and it seems to possibly plateau. This could be indicative that those k-values can also perform well to a certain degree. This could make sense because we have used 3 predictor variables, which could make the KNN more stable because our points might be relatively stable and not too far from each other."
